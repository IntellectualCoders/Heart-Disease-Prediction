# Heart Disease Prediction
In this machine learning project, We have collected the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and We will be using Machine Learning to predict whether any person is suffering from heart disease

Here we will be experimenting with 3 algorithms :-

1. KNeighborsClassifier
2. DecisionTreeClassifier
3. RandomForestClassifier
